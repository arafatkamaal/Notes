This document details the use regarding Perl's -p command line swtich:

As per the command line documentation:

      -p              assume loop like -n but print line also, like sed

Which means it will wrap a while(<>){} around the code that goes in {} but it also prints the '$_' variable. 
The $_ variable is printed at the state it is just before the closing '.

Eg: Increment the $_ and then add 3 to it

$ cat a.txt
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
$ cat a.txt| perl -ple '$_++,$_+=3'
