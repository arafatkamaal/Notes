This document details the use regarding Perl's -p command line swtich:

As per the command line documentation:

      -p              assume loop like -n but print line also, like sed

Which means it will wrap a while(<>){} around the code that goes in {} but it also prints the '$_' variable. 
The $_ variable is printed at the state it is just before the closing '.

Eg: Increment the $_ and then add 3 to it

$ cat a.txt
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
$ cat a.txt| perl -ple '$_++,$_+=3'
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12

---

$. variable stores the line number of the last filehandle accessed, this can be use to do some range based operations.

like for example: print lines 4-10

[mkamaal@shareeast-dr tmp]$ cat a.txt
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
a
s
d
f
q
w
e
r
t
y

[mkamaal@shareeast-dr tmp]$ cat a.txt| perl -ple '$_ x=(($.>3) && ($.<11))'
4
5
6
7
8
9
a
